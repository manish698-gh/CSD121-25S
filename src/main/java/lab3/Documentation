We made a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Java using classes and enums.
It lets two players take turns, checks who wins, and handles user input nicely.

Board class:
Handles the 3x3 game grid and core logic.
Stores player moves (Player[][] grid).
Checks for win (checkWin()), draw (isDraw()), and occupied positions (isTaken()).
Uses nested enums (Player, Row, Column) and a Position class to manage inputs and structure.

Console class:
 Manages user input via the terminal.
Prompts for row and column input.
Parses and validates user input into a Position object.

Main class:
Runs the game loop.
Alternates turns between Player X and O.
Displays the board, processes input, places moves, and checks for win/draw after each turn.

Enum Usage
An enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type in Java used to define a set of fixed, named values.
public enum Player { X, O }
public enum Row { TOP("t"), MIDDLE("m"), BOTTOM("b") }
